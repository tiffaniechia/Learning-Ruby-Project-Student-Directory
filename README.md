##Student Directory Project

The goal of this project is to introduce us to basic Ruby and familiarize ourselves with the command line. The aim is to build a very simple Ruby script that will let us maintain a list of current students at Makers Academy.

I has the ability to add new students by asking the user to input their names and relevant details. Hard validations have been added to ensure that these details are correctly entered. It will then show the list of students grouped by cohorts.
